# Currency Selector

Currency selector allows users to change the currency / sales channel (trade policy) they are browsing on the store.

It also allows an admin user to customize the label to be displayed in both blocks via site editor.
The default label is the token `{CurrencySymbol}` - which represents the currency symbol registered in the sales channel information. The tokens `{CurrencyCode}` and `{CustomLabel}` (registered via admin panel) are also available for interpolation. For more information on how to edit or set the `CustomLabel` go the section `Set a Custom Label through the admin`

## Configuration

:warning: **You need to have `vtex.binding-selector@2.x` as a peer dependency.**

:warning: **In order to the app work correctly on binding bounded accounts, the store has to have this app configured: [vtex.binding-countries](https://github.com/vtex-apps/binding-countries/), to ensure that the canonical address for all bindings has the `rootPath` in the URL.**

### Step 1 - Installing and Adding the Currency selector app to your theme's peerDependencies

On the CLI and run: vtex install vtex.currency-selector@1.x

Add the Currency selector app as a `peerDependency` in your `store-theme`'s `manifest.json` file:

```diff
 "peerDependencies": {
+  "vtex.currency-selector": "1.x"
+  "vtex.binding-selector": "2.x"
 }
```

Now, you can use all the blocks exported by the `currency-selector` app. Check out the two blocks available:

| Block name          | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `current-currency`  | Renders only the current currency. Useful to be used as a trigger for modals |
| `currency-selector` | Renders three posible layouts: dropdown, list and select.                    |

### Step 2 - Adding the Currency selector's blocks to your theme's templates

To add the Currency selector's blocks in your theme, you just need to declare them.

For example:

```json
"flex-layout.row#home": {
  "blocks": ["currency-selector"]
},

"currency-selector": {
  "props": {
      "layout": "select"
  }
},
```

`currency-selector`:

| Prop name | Type     | Description                                                                                                            | Default value |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `layout`  | `string` | This property is used to specify how the block will be displayed. Possible values are `dropdown`, `list` and `select`. | `dropdown`    |

`current-currency` doesn't take any props.

### Step 3 - Configuration in the admin

In order to be able to see our blocks it is necessary to add some sales channels to a binding.

Go to your account Admin Panel and under the Account Settings, there will be a new menu item called Currency Selector. Here we will add some sales channels to a binding:

1. Open the sales channel list of the binding you want to configure and click on `ADD`. This will open a modal.

2. In the modal, you can add the sales channels you want to display on your store from a dropdown. After selecting all the ones you want, click `SAVE`.

3. Now you can see the options you selected in that store / binding.

### Set a Custom Label through the admin

In addition, the customer can configure a customised label for each sales channel through the admin.

Go to the same page as in step 3

1. Add sales channels per binding and create a new custom label.
2. Modify the added sales channels. You can edit the custom label or delete the sales channel from the list.

## Customization
